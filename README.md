# Constellations
 Matplotlib Visualization

In this project, I am Dr. Jillian Bellovary, a real-life astronomer for the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History. As an astronomer, part of my job is to study the stars. I’ve recently become interested in the constellation Orion, a collection of stars that appear in our night sky and form the shape of Orion, a warrior God from ancient Greek mythology.

As a researcher on the Hayden Planetarium team, I am in charge of visualizing the Orion constellation using the Matplotlib function .scatter().

I will create both a 2D and a 3D visualization of the position of Orion’s stars and get a better sense of their actual positions. To achieve this, I will be mapping real data from outer space that maps the position of the stars in the sky.

The goal of the project is to understand spatial perspective. Once I visualize Orion in both 2D and 3D, I will be able to see the difference in the constellation shape humans see from earth versus the actual position of the stars that make up this constellation.
